    Routes define which methods handles requests to certain paths, and are defined
    using the `@route`-decorator. The decorator takes one argument that defines which
    path the method is used for. The decorated function recieves one argument from pyroutes
    containing a `Request`-instance with all the information for that particular request.

    **Defining routes**

    This is a simple example route ::

      from pyroutes import route
      from pyroutes.http.response import Response

      @route('/')
      def index(request):
          return Response('Hello world')


    **How routes are matched to paths.**

    One property of the routes are that matches are done on an best effort basis, starting
    from the top of the tree and going down. This results in handler being delt request for
    their defined path and every path over it. This is true for all paths except the
    root-handler ('/').
